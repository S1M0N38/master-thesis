abstract: Designing convolutional neural networks (CNN) for mobile devices is challenging
  because mobile models need to be small and fast, yet still accurate. Although significant
  efforts have been dedicated to design and improve mobile CNNs on all dimensions,
  it is very difficult to manually balance these trade-offs when there are so many
  architectural possibilities to consider. In this paper, we propose an automated
  mobile neural architecture search (MNAS) approach, which explicitly incorporate
  model latency into the main objective so that the search can identify a model that
  achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency. Unlike previous work, where
  latency is considered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), our approach
  directly measures real-world inference latency by executing the model on mobile
  phones. To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search space
  size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that encourages layer
  diversity throughout the network. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
  outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN models across multiple vision tasks. On
  the ImageNet classification task, our MnasNet achieves 75.2% top-1 accuracy with
  78ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.8x faster than MobileNetV2 [29] with 0.5%
  higher accuracy and 2.3x faster than NASNet [36] with 1.2% higher accuracy. Our
  MnasNet also achieves better mAP quality than MobileNets for COCO object detection.

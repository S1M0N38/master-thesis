abstract: The Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success on a variety
  of computer vision tasks, however, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
  To address this problem, we propose to improve the local smoothness of the representation
  space, by integrating a margin-based triplet embedding regularization term into
  the classification objective, so that the obtained model learns to resist adversarial
  examples. The regularization term consists of two steps optimizations which find
  potential perturbations and punish them by a large margin in an iterative way. Experimental
  results on MNIST, CASIA-WebFace, VGGFace2 and MS-Celeb-1M reveal that our approach
  increases the robustness of the network against both feature and label adversarial
  attacks in simple object classification and deep face recognition.

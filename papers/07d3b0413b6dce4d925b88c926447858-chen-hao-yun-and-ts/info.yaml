abstract: Label hierarchies widely exist in many vision-related problems, ranging
  from explicit label hierarchies existed in image classification to latent label
  hierarchies existed in semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art methods
  often deploy cross-entropy loss that implicitly assumes class labels to be exclusive
  and thus independence from each other. Motivated by the fact that classes from the
  same parental category usually share certain similarity, we design a new training
  diagram called Hierarchical Complement Objective Training (HCOT) that leverages
  the information from label hierarchy. HCOT maximizes the probability of the ground
  truth class, and at the same time, neutralizes the probabilities of rest of the
  classes in a hierarchical fashion, making the model take advantage of the label
  hierarchy explicitly. The proposed HCOT is evaluated on both image classification
  and semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results confirm that HCOT outperforms
  state-of-the-art models in CIFAR-100, ImageNet-2012, and PASCAL-Context. The study
  further demonstrates that HCOT can be applied on tasks with latent label hierarchies,
  which is a common characteristic in many machine learning tasks.

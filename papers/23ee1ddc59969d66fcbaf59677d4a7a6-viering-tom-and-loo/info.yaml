abstract: Learning curves provide insight into the dependence of a learner's generalization
  performance on the training set size. This important tool can be used for model
  selection, to predict the effect of more training data, and to reduce the computational
  complexity of model training and hyperparameter tuning. This review recounts the
  origins of the term, provides a formal definition of the learning curve, and briefly
  covers basics such as its estimation. Our main contribution is a comprehensive overview
  of the literature regarding the shape of learning curves. We discuss empirical and
  theoretical evidence that supports well-behaved curves that often have the shape
  of a power law or an exponential. We consider the learning curves of Gaussian processes,
  the complex shapes they can display, and the factors influencing them. We draw specific
  attention to examples of learning curves that are ill-behaved, showing worse learning
  performance with more training data. To wrap up, we point out various open problems
  that warrant deeper empirical and theoretical investigation. All in all, our review
  underscores that learning curves are surprisingly diverse and no universal model
  can be identified.

abstract: Because meaningful sentences are composed of meaningful words, any system that
  hopes to process natural languages as people do must have information about
  words and their meanings. This information is traditionally provided through
  dictionaries, and machine-readable dictionaries are now widely available. But
  dictionary entries evolved for the convenience of human readers, not for
  machines. WordNet provides a more effective combination of traditional
  lexicographic information and modern computing. WordNet is an online lexical
  database designed for use under program control. English nouns, verbs,
  adjectives, and adverbs are organized into sets of synonyms, each representing
  a lexicalized concept. Semantic relations link the synonym sets

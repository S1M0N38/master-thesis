abstract: The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge is a benchmark in
  object category classification and detection on hundreds of object categories and
  millions of images. The challenge has been run annually from 2010 to present, attracting
  participation from more than fifty institutions.   This paper describes the creation
  of this benchmark dataset and the advances in object recognition that have been
  possible as a result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground
  truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition,
  provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the field of large-scale image
  classification and object detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision
  accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the five years
  of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements.

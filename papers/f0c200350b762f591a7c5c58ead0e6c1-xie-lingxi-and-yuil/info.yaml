abstract: The deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the state-of-the-art solution
  for large-scale visual recognition. Following basic principles such as increasing
  the depth and constructing highway connections, researchers have manually designed
  a lot of fixed network structures and verified their effectiveness.   In this paper,
  we discuss the possibility of learning deep network structures automatically. Note
  that the number of possible network structures increases exponentially with the
  number of layers in the network, which inspires us to adopt the genetic algorithm
  to efficiently traverse this large search space. We first propose an encoding method
  to represent each network structure in a fixed-length binary string, and initialize
  the genetic algorithm by generating a set of randomized individuals. In each generation,
  we define standard genetic operations, e.g., selection, mutation and crossover,
  to eliminate weak individuals and then generate more competitive ones. The competitiveness
  of each individual is defined as its recognition accuracy, which is obtained via
  training the network from scratch and evaluating it on a validation set. We run
  the genetic process on two small datasets, i.e., MNIST and CIFAR10, demonstrating
  its ability to evolve and find high-quality structures which are little studied
  before. These structures are also transferrable to the large-scale ILSVRC2012 dataset.

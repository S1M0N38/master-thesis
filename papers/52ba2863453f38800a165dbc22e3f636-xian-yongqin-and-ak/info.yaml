abstract: We present a novel latent embedding model for learning a compatibility function
  between image and class embeddings, in the context of zero-shot classification.
  The proposed method augments the state-of-the-art bilinear compatibility model by
  incorporating latent variables. Instead of learning a single bilinear map, it learns
  a collection of maps with the selection, of which map to use, being a latent variable
  for the current image-class pair. We train the model with a ranking based objective
  function which penalizes incorrect rankings of the true class for a given image.
  We empirically demonstrate that our model improves the state-of-the-art for various
  class embeddings consistently on three challenging publicly available datasets for
  the zero-shot setting. Moreover, our method leads to visually highly interpretable
  results with clear clusters of different fine-grained object properties that correspond
  to different latent variable maps.

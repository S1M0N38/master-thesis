abstract: 'Whether what you see in Figure 1 is a "flamingo" or a "bird", is the question
  we ask in this paper. While fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) strives to
  arrive at the former, for the majority of us non-experts just "bird" would probably
  suffice. The real question is therefore -- how can we tailor for different fine-grained
  definitions under divergent levels of expertise. For that, we re-envisage the traditional
  setting of FGVC, from single-label classification, to that of top-down traversal
  of a pre-defined coarse-to-fine label hierarchy -- so that our answer becomes "bird"-->"Phoenicopteriformes"-->"Phoenicopteridae"-->"flamingo".
  To approach this new problem, we first conduct a comprehensive human study where
  we confirm that most participants prefer multi-granularity labels, regardless whether
  they consider themselves experts. We then discover the key intuition that: coarse-level
  label prediction exacerbates fine-grained feature learning, yet fine-level feature
  betters the learning of coarse-level classifier. This discovery enables us to design
  a very simple albeit surprisingly effective solution to our new problem, where we
  (i) leverage level-specific classification heads to disentangle coarse-level features
  with fine-grained ones, and (ii) allow finer-grained features to participate in
  coarser-grained label predictions, which in turn helps with better disentanglement.
  Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in the new FGVC setting,
  and performs better than state-of-the-art on traditional single-label FGVC problem
  as well. Thanks to its simplicity, our method can be easily implemented on top of
  any existing FGVC frameworks and is parameter-free.'

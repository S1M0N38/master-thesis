abstract: We present a simple regularization of adversarial perturbations based upon
  the perceptual loss. While the resulting perturbations remain imperceptible to the
  human eye, they differ from existing adversarial perturbations in that they are
  semi-sparse alterations that highlight objects and regions of interest while leaving
  the background unaltered. As a semantically meaningful adverse perturbations, it
  forms a bridge between counterfactual explanations and adversarial perturbations
  in the space of images. We evaluate our approach on several standard explainability
  benchmarks, namely, weak localization, insertion deletion, and the pointing game
  demonstrating that perceptually regularized counterfactuals are an effective explanation
  for image-based classifiers.

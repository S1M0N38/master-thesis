abstract: Learning with a primary objective, such as softmax cross entropy for classification
  and sequence generation, has been the norm for training deep neural networks for
  years. Although being a widely-adopted approach, using cross entropy as the primary
  objective exploits mostly the information from the ground-truth class for maximizing
  data likelihood, and largely ignores information from the complement (incorrect)
  classes. We argue that, in addition to the primary objective, training also using
  a complement objective that leverages information from the complement classes can
  be effective in improving model performance. This motivates us to study a new training
  paradigm that maximizes the likelihood of the groundtruth class while neutralizing
  the probabilities of the complement classes. We conduct extensive experiments on
  multiple tasks ranging from computer vision to natural language understanding. The
  experimental results confirm that, compared to the conventional training with just
  one primary objective, training also with the complement objective further improves
  the performance of the state-of-the-art models across all tasks. In addition to
  the accuracy improvement, we also show that models trained with both primary and
  complement objectives are more robust to single-step adversarial attacks.

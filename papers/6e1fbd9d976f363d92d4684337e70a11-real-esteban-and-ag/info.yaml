abstract: The effort devoted to hand-crafting neural network image classifiers has
  motivated the use of architecture search to discover them automatically. Although
  evolutionary algorithms have been repeatedly applied to neural network topologies,
  the image classifiers thus discovered have remained inferior to human-crafted ones.
  Here, we evolve an image classifier---AmoebaNet-A---that surpasses hand-designs
  for the first time. To do this, we modify the tournament selection evolutionary
  algorithm by introducing an age property to favor the younger genotypes. Matching
  size, AmoebaNet-A has comparable accuracy to current state-of-the-art ImageNet models
  discovered with more complex architecture-search methods. Scaled to larger size,
  AmoebaNet-A sets a new state-of-the-art 83.9% / 96.6% top-5 ImageNet accuracy. In
  a controlled comparison against a well known reinforcement learning algorithm, we
  give evidence that evolution can obtain results faster with the same hardware, especially
  at the earlier stages of the search. This is relevant when fewer compute resources
  are available. Evolution is, thus, a simple method to effectively discover high-quality
  architectures.

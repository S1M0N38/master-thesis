abstract: In recent years, research on adversarial attacks has become a hot spot.
  Although current literature on the transfer-based adversarial attack has achieved
  promising results for improving the transferability to unseen black-box models,
  it still leaves a long way to go. Inspired by the idea of meta-learning, this paper
  proposes a novel architecture called Meta Gradient Adversarial Attack (MGAA), which
  is plug-and-play and can be integrated with any existing gradient-based attack method
  for improving the cross-model transferability. Specifically, we randomly sample
  multiple models from a model zoo to compose different tasks and iteratively simulate
  a white-box attack and a black-box attack in each task. By narrowing the gap between
  the gradient directions in white-box and black-box attacks, the transferability
  of adversarial examples on the black-box setting can be improved. Extensive experiments
  on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets show that our architecture outperforms the
  state-of-the-art methods for both black-box and white-box attack settings.

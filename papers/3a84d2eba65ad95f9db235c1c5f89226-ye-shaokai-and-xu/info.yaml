abstract: It is well known that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial
  attacks, which are implemented by adding crafted perturbations onto benign examples.
  Min-max robust optimization based adversarial training can provide a notion of security
  against adversarial attacks. However, adversarial robustness requires a significantly
  larger capacity of the network than that for the natural training with only benign
  examples. This paper proposes a framework of concurrent adversarial training and
  weight pruning that enables model compression while still preserving the adversarial
  robustness and essentially tackles the dilemma of adversarial training. Furthermore,
  this work studies two hypotheses about weight pruning in the conventional setting
  and finds that weight pruning is essential for reducing the network model size in
  the adversarial setting, training a small model from scratch even with inherited
  initialization from the large model cannot achieve both adversarial robustness and
  high standard accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/yeshaokai/Robustness-Aware-Pruning-ADMM.

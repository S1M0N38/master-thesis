abstract: Label hierarchies are often available apriori as part of biological taxonomy
  or language datasets WordNet. Several works exploit these to learn hierarchy aware
  features in order to improve the classifier to make semantically meaningful mistakes
  while maintaining or reducing the overall error. In this paper, we propose a novel
  approach for learning Hierarchy Aware Features (HAF) that leverages classifiers
  at each level of the hierarchy that are constrained to generate predictions consistent
  with the label hierarchy. The classifiers are trained by minimizing a Jensen-Shannon
  Divergence with target soft labels obtained from the fine-grained classifiers. Additionally,
  we employ a simple geometric loss that constrains the feature space geometry to
  capture the semantic structure of the label space. HAF is a training time approach
  that improves the mistakes while maintaining top-1 error, thereby, addressing the
  problem of cross-entropy loss that treats all mistakes as equal. We evaluate HAF
  on three hierarchical datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results on the iNaturalist-19
  and CIFAR-100 datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/07Agarg/HAF

abstract: Deep neural networks trained for classification have been found to learn
  powerful image representations, which are also often used for other tasks such as
  comparing images w.r.t. their visual similarity. However, visual similarity does
  not imply semantic similarity. In order to learn semantically discriminative features,
  we propose to map images onto class embeddings whose pair-wise dot products correspond
  to a measure of semantic similarity between classes. Such an embedding does not
  only improve image retrieval results, but could also facilitate integrating semantics
  for other tasks, e.g., novelty detection or few-shot learning. We introduce a deterministic
  algorithm for computing the class centroids directly based on prior world-knowledge
  encoded in a hierarchy of classes such as WordNet. Experiments on CIFAR-100, NABirds,
  and ImageNet show that our learned semantic image embeddings improve the semantic
  consistency of image retrieval results by a large margin.

abstract: While multi-step adversarial training is widely popular as an effective
  defense method against strong adversarial attacks, its computational cost is notoriously
  expensive, compared to standard training. Several single-step adversarial training
  methods have been proposed to mitigate the above-mentioned overhead cost; however,
  their performance is not sufficiently reliable depending on the optimization setting.
  To overcome such limitations, we deviate from the existing input-space-based adversarial
  training regime and propose a single-step latent adversarial training method (SLAT),
  which leverages the gradients of latent representation as the latent adversarial
  perturbation. We demonstrate that the L1 norm of feature gradients is implicitly
  regularized through the adopted latent perturbation, thereby recovering local linearity
  and ensuring reliable performance, compared to the existing single-step adversarial
  training methods. Because latent perturbation is based on the gradients of the latent
  representations which can be obtained for free in the process of input gradients
  computation, the proposed method costs roughly the same time as the fast gradient
  sign method. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method, despite its
  structural simplicity, outperforms state-of-the-art accelerated adversarial training
  methods.

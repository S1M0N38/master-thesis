abstract: Single-image super-resolution aims to generate a high-resolution version
  of a low-resolution image, which serves as an essential component in many computer
  vision applications. This paper investigates the robustness of deep learning-based
  super-resolution methods against adversarial attacks, which can significantly deteriorate
  the super-resolved images without noticeable distortion in the attacked low-resolution
  images. It is demonstrated that state-of-the-art deep super-resolution methods are
  highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Different levels of robustness of different
  methods are analyzed theoretically and experimentally. We also present analysis
  on transferability of attacks, and feasibility of targeted attacks and universal
  attacks.

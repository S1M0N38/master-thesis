abstract: Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual
  learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper
  than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual
  functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions.
  We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks
  are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth.
  On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x
  deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual
  nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place
  on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with
  100 and 1000 layers.   The depth of representations is of central importance for
  many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations,
  we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep
  residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions,
  where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization,
  COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.

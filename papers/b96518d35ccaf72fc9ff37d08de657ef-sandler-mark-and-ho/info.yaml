abstract: In this paper we describe a new mobile architecture, MobileNetV2, that improves
  the state of the art performance of mobile models on multiple tasks and benchmarks
  as well as across a spectrum of different model sizes. We also describe efficient
  ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we
  call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation
  models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3.   The
  MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input
  and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional
  residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses
  lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion
  layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the
  narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this
  improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally,
  our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness
  of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis.
  We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, COCO object detection, VOC
  image segmentation. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations
  measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as the number of parameters

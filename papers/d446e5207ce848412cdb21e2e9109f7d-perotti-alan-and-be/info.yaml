abstract: 'Images are loaded with semantic information that pertains to real-world
  ontologies: dog breeds share mammalian similarities, food pictures are often depicted
  in domestic environments, and so on. However, when training machine learning models
  for image classification, the relative similarities amongst object classes are commonly
  paired with one-hot-encoded labels. According to this logic, if an image is labelled
  as ''spoon'', then ''tea-spoon'' and ''shark'' are equally wrong in terms of training
  loss. To overcome this limitation, we explore the integration of additional goals
  that reflect ontological and semantic knowledge, improving model interpretability
  and trustworthiness. We suggest a generic approach that allows to derive an additional
  loss term starting from any kind of semantic information about the classification
  label. First, we show how to apply our approach to ontologies and word embeddings,
  and discuss how the resulting information can drive a supervised learning process.
  Second, we use our semantically enriched loss to train image classifiers, and analyse
  the trade-offs between accuracy, mistake severity, and learned internal representations.
  Finally, we discuss how this approach can be further exploited in terms of explainability
  and adversarial robustness. Code repository: https://github.com/S1M0N38/semantic-encodings'

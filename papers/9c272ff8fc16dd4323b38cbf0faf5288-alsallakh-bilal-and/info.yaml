abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) currently achieve state-of-the-art
  accuracy in image classification. With a growing number of classes, the accuracy
  usually drops as the possibilities of confusion increase. Interestingly, the class
  confusion patterns follow a hierarchical structure over the classes. We present
  visual-analytics methods to reveal and analyze this hierarchy of similar classes
  in relation with CNN-internal data. We found that this hierarchy not only dictates
  the confusion patterns between the classes, it furthermore dictates the learning
  behavior of CNNs. In particular, the early layers in these networks develop feature
  detectors that can separate high-level groups of classes quite well, even after
  a few training epochs. In contrast, the latter layers require substantially more
  epochs to develop specialized feature detectors that can separate individual classes.
  We demonstrate how these insights are key to significant improvement in accuracy
  by designing hierarchy-aware CNNs that accelerate model convergence and alleviate
  overfitting. We further demonstrate how our methods help in identifying various
  quality issues in the training data.

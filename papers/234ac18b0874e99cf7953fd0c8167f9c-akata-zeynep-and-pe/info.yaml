abstract: 'Attributes act as intermediate representations that enable parameter sharing
  between classes, a must when training data is scarce. We propose to view attribute-based
  image classification as a label-embedding problem: each class is embedded in the
  space of attribute vectors. We introduce a function that measures the compatibility
  between an image and a label embedding. The parameters of this function are learned
  on a training set of labeled samples to ensure that, given an image, the correct
  classes rank higher than the incorrect ones. Results on the Animals With Attributes
  and Caltech-UCSD-Birds datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms the
  standard Direct Attribute Prediction baseline in a zero-shot learning scenario.
  Label embedding enjoys a built-in ability to leverage alternative sources of information
  instead of or in addition to attributes, such as e.g. class hierarchies or textual
  descriptions. Moreover, label embedding encompasses the whole range of learning
  settings from zero-shot learning to regular learning with a large number of labeled
  examples.'

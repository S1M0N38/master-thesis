abstract: Representation learning has become an invaluable approach for learning from
  symbolic data such as text and graphs. However, while complex symbolic datasets
  often exhibit a latent hierarchical structure, state-of-the-art methods typically
  learn embeddings in Euclidean vector spaces, which do not account for this property.
  For this purpose, we introduce a new approach for learning hierarchical representations
  of symbolic data by embedding them into hyperbolic space -- or more precisely into
  an n-dimensional Poincar\'e ball. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry, this
  allows us to learn parsimonious representations of symbolic data by simultaneously
  capturing hierarchy and similarity. We introduce an efficient algorithm to learn
  the embeddings based on Riemannian optimization and show experimentally that Poincar\'e
  embeddings outperform Euclidean embeddings significantly on data with latent hierarchies,
  both in terms of representation capacity and in terms of generalization ability.

abstract: Robust machine learning is currently one of the most prominent topics which
  could potentially help shaping a future of advanced AI platforms that not only perform
  well in average cases but also in worst cases or adverse situations. Despite the
  long-term vision, however, existing studies on black-box adversarial attacks are
  still restricted to very specific settings of threat models (e.g., single distortion
  metric and restrictive assumption on target model's feedback to queries) and/or
  suffer from prohibitively high query complexity. To push for further advances in
  this field, we introduce a general framework based on an operator splitting method,
  the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to devise efficient, robust
  black-box attacks that work with various distortion metrics and feedback settings
  without incurring high query complexity. Due to the black-box nature of the threat
  model, the proposed ADMM solution framework is integrated with zeroth-order (ZO)
  optimization and Bayesian optimization (BO), and thus is applicable to the gradient-free
  regime. This results in two new black-box adversarial attack generation methods,
  ZO-ADMM and BO-ADMM. Our empirical evaluations on image classification datasets
  show that our proposed approaches have much lower function query complexities compared
  to state-of-the-art attack methods, but achieve very competitive attack success
  rates.

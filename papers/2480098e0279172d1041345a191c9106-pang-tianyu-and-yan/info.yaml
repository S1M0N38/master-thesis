abstract: Adversarial training (AT) is one of the most effective defenses against
  adversarial attacks for deep learning models. In this work, we advocate incorporating
  the hypersphere embedding (HE) mechanism into the AT procedure by regularizing the
  features onto compact manifolds, which constitutes a lightweight yet effective module
  to blend in the strength of representation learning. Our extensive analyses reveal
  that AT and HE are well coupled to benefit the robustness of the adversarially trained
  models from several aspects. We validate the effectiveness and adaptability of HE
  by embedding it into the popular AT frameworks including PGD-AT, ALP, and TRADES,
  as well as the FreeAT and FastAT strategies. In the experiments, we evaluate our
  methods under a wide range of adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets,
  which verifies that integrating HE can consistently enhance the model robustness
  for each AT framework with little extra computation.

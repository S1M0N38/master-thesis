abstract: Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded
  on computer storage media, for computing numeric representations of words. One
  of the methods includes obtaining a set of training data, wherein the set of
  training data comprises sequences of words; training a classifier and an
  embedding function on the set of training data, wherein training the embedding
  function comprises obtained trained values of the embedding function
  parameters; processing each word in the vocabulary using the embedding function
  in accordance with the trained values of the embedding function parameters to
  generate a respective numerical representation of each word in the vocabulary
  in the high-dimensional space; and associating each word in the vocabulary with
  the respective numeric representation of the word in the high-dimensional
  space.

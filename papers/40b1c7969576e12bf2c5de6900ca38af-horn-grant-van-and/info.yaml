abstract: Existing image classification datasets used in computer vision tend to have
  a uniform distribution of images across object categories. In contrast, the natural
  world is heavily imbalanced, as some species are more abundant and easier to photograph
  than others. To encourage further progress in challenging real world conditions
  we present the iNaturalist species classification and detection dataset, consisting
  of 859,000 images from over 5,000 different species of plants and animals. It features
  visually similar species, captured in a wide variety of situations, from all over
  the world. Images were collected with different camera types, have varying image
  quality, feature a large class imbalance, and have been verified by multiple citizen
  scientists. We discuss the collection of the dataset and present extensive baseline
  experiments using state-of-the-art computer vision classification and detection
  models. Results show that current non-ensemble based methods achieve only 67% top
  one classification accuracy, illustrating the difficulty of the dataset. Specifically,
  we observe poor results for classes with small numbers of training examples suggesting
  more attention is needed in low-shot learning.

abstract: In this work, we present a simple, highly efficient and modularized Dual
  Path Network (DPN) for image classification which presents a new topology of connection
  paths internally. By revealing the equivalence of the state-of-the-art Residual
  Network (ResNet) and Densely Convolutional Network (DenseNet) within the HORNN framework,
  we find that ResNet enables feature re-usage while DenseNet enables new features
  exploration which are both important for learning good representations. To enjoy
  the benefits from both path topologies, our proposed Dual Path Network shares common
  features while maintaining the flexibility to explore new features through dual
  path architectures. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, ImagNet-1k,
  Places365 and PASCAL VOC, clearly demonstrate superior performance of the proposed
  DPN over state-of-the-arts. In particular, on the ImagNet-1k dataset, a shallow
  DPN surpasses the best ResNeXt-101(64x4d) with 26% smaller model size, 25% less
  computational cost and 8% lower memory consumption, and a deeper DPN (DPN-131) further
  pushes the state-of-the-art single model performance with about 2 times faster training
  speed. Experiments on the Places365 large-scale scene dataset, PASCAL VOC detection
  dataset, and PASCAL VOC segmentation dataset also demonstrate its consistently better
  performance than DenseNet, ResNet and the latest ResNeXt model over various applications.

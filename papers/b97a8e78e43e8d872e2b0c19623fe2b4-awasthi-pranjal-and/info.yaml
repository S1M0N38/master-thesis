abstract: Adversarial robustness corresponds to the susceptibility of deep neural
  networks to imperceptible perturbations made at test time. In the context of image
  tasks, many algorithms have been proposed to make neural networks robust to adversarial
  perturbations made to the input pixels. These perturbations are typically measured
  in an $\ell_p$ norm. However, robustness often holds only for the specific attack
  used for training. In this work we extend the above setting to consider the problem
  of training of deep neural networks that can be made simultaneously robust to perturbations
  applied in multiple natural representation spaces. For the case of image data, examples
  include the standard pixel representation as well as the representation in the discrete
  cosine transform~(DCT) basis. We design a theoretically sound algorithm with formal
  guarantees for the above problem. Furthermore, our guarantees also hold when the
  goal is to require robustness with respect to multiple $\ell_p$ norm based attacks.
  We then derive an efficient practical implementation and demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach on standard datasets for image classification.

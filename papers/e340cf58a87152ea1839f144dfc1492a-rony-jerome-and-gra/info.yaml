abstract: Adversarial attack algorithms are dominated by penalty methods, which are
  slow in practice, or more efficient distance-customized methods, which are heavily
  tailored to the properties of the distance considered. We propose a white-box attack
  algorithm to generate minimally perturbed adversarial examples based on Augmented
  Lagrangian principles. We bring several algorithmic modifications, which have a
  crucial effect on performance. Our attack enjoys the generality of penalty methods
  and the computational efficiency of distance-customized algorithms, and can be readily
  used for a wide set of distances. We compare our attack to state-of-the-art methods
  on three datasets and several models, and consistently obtain competitive performances
  with similar or lower computational complexity.

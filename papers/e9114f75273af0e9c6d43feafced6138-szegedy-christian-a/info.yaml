abstract: We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed "Inception",
  which was responsible for setting the new state of the art for classification and
  detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC
  2014). The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the
  computing resources inside the network. This was achieved by a carefully crafted
  design that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping
  the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions
  were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing.
  One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC 2014 is called GoogLeNet,
  a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification
  and detection.

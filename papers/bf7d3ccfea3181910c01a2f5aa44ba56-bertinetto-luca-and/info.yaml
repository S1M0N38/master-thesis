abstract: 'Deep neural networks have improved image classification dramatically over
  the past decade, but have done so by focusing on performance measures that treat
  all classes other than the ground truth as equally wrong. This has led to a situation
  in which mistakes are less likely to be made than before, but are equally likely
  to be absurd or catastrophic when they do occur. Past works have recognised and
  tried to address this issue of mistake severity, often by using graph distances
  in class hierarchies, but this has largely been neglected since the advent of the
  current deep learning era in computer vision. In this paper, we aim to renew interest
  in this problem by reviewing past approaches and proposing two simple modifications
  of the cross-entropy loss which outperform the prior art under several metrics on
  two large datasets with complex class hierarchies: tieredImageNet and iNaturalist''19.'

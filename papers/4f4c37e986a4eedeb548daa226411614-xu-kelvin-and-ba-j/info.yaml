abstract: 'Inspired by recent work in machine translation and object detection, we
  introduce an attention based model that automatically learns to describe the content
  of images. We describe how we can train this model in a deterministic manner using
  standard backpropagation techniques and stochastically by maximizing a variational
  lower bound. We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically
  learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words
  in the output sequence. We validate the use of attention with state-of-the-art performance
  on three benchmark datasets: Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS COCO.'

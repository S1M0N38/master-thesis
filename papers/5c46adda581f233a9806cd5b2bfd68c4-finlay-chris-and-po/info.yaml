abstract: 'Adversarial attacks for image classification are small perturbations to
  images that are designed to cause misclassification by a model. Adversarial attacks
  formally correspond to an optimization problem: find a minimum norm image perturbation,
  constrained to cause misclassification. A number of effective attacks have been
  developed. However, to date, no gradient-based attacks have used best practices
  from the optimization literature to solve this constrained minimization problem.
  We design a new untargeted attack, based on these best practices, using the established
  logarithmic barrier method. On average, our attack distance is similar or better
  than all state-of-the-art attacks on benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet-1K).
  In addition, our method performs significantly better on the most challenging images,
  those which normally require larger perturbations for misclassification. We employ
  the LogBarrier attack on several adversarially defended models, and show that it
  adversarially perturbs all images more efficiently than other attacks: the distance
  needed to perturb all images is significantly smaller with the LogBarrier attack
  than with other state-of-the-art attacks.'

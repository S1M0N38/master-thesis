abstract: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent
  or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing
  models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose
  a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms,
  dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine
  translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable
  and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on
  the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best
  results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation
  task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8
  after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs
  of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes
  well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing
  both with large and limited training data.

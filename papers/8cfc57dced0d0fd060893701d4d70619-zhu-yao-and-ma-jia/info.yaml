abstract: Recently, some works found an interesting phenomenon that adversarially
  robust classifiers can generate good images comparable to generative models. We
  investigate this phenomenon from an energy perspective and provide a novel explanation.
  We reformulate adversarial example generation, adversarial training, and image generation
  in terms of an energy function. We find that adversarial training contributes to
  obtaining an energy function that is flat and has low energy around the real data,
  which is the key for generative capability. Based on our new understanding, we further
  propose a better adversarial training method, Joint Energy Adversarial Training
  (JEAT), which can generate high-quality images and achieve new state-of-the-art
  robustness under a wide range of attacks. The Inception Score of the images (CIFAR-10)
  generated by JEAT is 8.80, much better than original robust classifiers (7.50).

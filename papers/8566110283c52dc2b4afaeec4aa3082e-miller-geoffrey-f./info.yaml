abstract: 'We present a genetic algorithm method that evolves neural network
  architectures for specific tasks. Each network architecture is represented as a
  connection constraint matrix mapped directly into a bit-string genotype.
  Modified standard genetic operators act on populations of these genotypes to
  produce network architectures with higher fitness is assessed by training
  particular network instantiations and recording their final performance error.
  Three applications of this method to simple network mapping tasks are
  discussed.'

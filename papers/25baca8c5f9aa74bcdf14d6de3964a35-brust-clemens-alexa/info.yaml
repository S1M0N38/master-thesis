abstract: One of the most prominent problems in machine learning in the age of deep
  learning is the availability of sufficiently large annotated datasets. For specific
  domains, e.g. animal species, a long-tail distribution means that some classes are
  observed and annotated insufficiently. Additional labels can be prohibitively expensive,
  e.g. because domain experts need to be involved. However, there is more information
  available that is to the best of our knowledge not exploited accordingly. In this
  paper, we propose to make use of preexisting class hierarchies like WordNet to integrate
  additional domain knowledge into classification. We encode the properties of such
  a class hierarchy into a probabilistic model. From there, we derive a novel label
  encoding and a corresponding loss function. On the ImageNet and NABirds datasets
  our method offers a relative improvement of 10.4% and 9.6% in accuracy over the
  baseline respectively. After less than a third of training time, it is already able
  to match the baseline's fine-grained recognition performance. Both results show
  that our suggested method is efficient and effective.

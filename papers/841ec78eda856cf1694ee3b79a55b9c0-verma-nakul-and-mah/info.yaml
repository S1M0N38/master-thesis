abstract: 'Categories in multi-class data are often part of an underlying
  semantic taxonomy. Recent work in object classification has found interesting
  ways to use this taxonomy structure to develop better recognition algorithms.
  Here we propose a novel framework to learn similarity metrics using the class
  taxonomy. We show that a nearest neighbor classifier using the learned metrics
  gets improved performance over the best discriminative methods. Moreover, by
  incorporating the taxonomy, our learned metrics can also help in some taxonomy
  specific applications. We show that the metrics can help determine the correct
  placement of a new category that was not part of the original taxonomy, and can
  provide effective classification amongst categories local to specific subtrees
  of the taxonomy.'

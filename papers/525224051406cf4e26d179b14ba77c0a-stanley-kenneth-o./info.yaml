abstract: An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage
  from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method,
  NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology
  method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the
  increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of
  different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and
  (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series
  of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system
  as a whole and to each other. What results is signicantly faster learning. NEAT
  is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for
  evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the
  possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening
  the analogy with biological evolution.

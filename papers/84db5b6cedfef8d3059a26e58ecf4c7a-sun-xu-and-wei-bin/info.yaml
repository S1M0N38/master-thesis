abstract: We propose a method, called Label Embedding Network, which can learn label
  representation (label embedding) during the training process of deep networks. With
  the proposed method, the label embedding is adaptively and automatically learned
  through back propagation. The original one-hot represented loss function is converted
  into a new loss function with soft distributions, such that the originally unrelated
  labels have continuous interactions with each other during the training process.
  As a result, the trained model can achieve substantially higher accuracy and with
  faster convergence speed. Experimental results based on competitive tasks demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the learned label embedding is reasonable
  and interpretable. The proposed method achieves comparable or even better results
  than the state-of-the-art systems. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/lancopku/LabelEmb}.

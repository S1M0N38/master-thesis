abstract: Neural networks have proven effective at solving difficult problems but
  designing their architectures can be challenging, even for image classification
  problems alone. Our goal is to minimize human participation, so we employ evolutionary
  algorithms to discover such networks automatically. Despite significant computational
  requirements, we show that it is now possible to evolve models with accuracies within
  the range of those published in the last year. Specifically, we employ simple evolutionary
  techniques at unprecedented scales to discover models for the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
  datasets, starting from trivial initial conditions and reaching accuracies of 94.6%
  (95.6% for ensemble) and 77.0%, respectively. To do this, we use novel and intuitive
  mutation operators that navigate large search spaces; we stress that no human participation
  is required once evolution starts and that the output is a fully-trained model.
  Throughout this work, we place special emphasis on the repeatability of results,
  the variability in the outcomes and the computational requirements.

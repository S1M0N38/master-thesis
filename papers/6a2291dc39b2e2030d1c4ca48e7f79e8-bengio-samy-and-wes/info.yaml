abstract: Multi-class classification becomes challenging at test time when the number
  of classes is very large and testing against every possible class can become computationally
  infeasible. This problem can be alleviated by imposing (or learning) a structure
  over the set of classes. We propose an algorithm for learning a tree-structure of
  classifiers which, by optimizing the overall tree loss, provides superior accuracy
  to existing tree labeling methods. We also propose a method that learns to embed
  labels in a low dimensional space that is faster than non-embedding approaches and
  has superior accuracy to existing embedding approaches. Finally we combine the two
  ideas resulting in the label embedding tree that outperforms alternative methods
  including One-vs-Rest while being orders of magnitude faster.

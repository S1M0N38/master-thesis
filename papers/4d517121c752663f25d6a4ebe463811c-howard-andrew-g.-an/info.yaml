abstract: We present a class of efficient models called MobileNets for mobile and
  embedded vision applications. MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture
  that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks.
  We introduce two simple global hyper-parameters that efficiently trade off between
  latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the
  right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem.
  We present extensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong
  performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then
  demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications
  and use cases including object detection, finegrain classification, face attributes
  and large scale geo-localization.

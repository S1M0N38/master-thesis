abstract: Deep neural networks continue to awe the world with their remarkable performance.
  Their predictions, however, are prone to be corrupted by adversarial examples that
  are imperceptible to humans. Current efforts to improve the robustness of neural
  networks against adversarial examples are focused on developing robust training
  methods, which update the weights of a neural network in a more robust direction.
  In this work, we take a step beyond training of the weight parameters and consider
  the problem of designing an adversarially robust neural architecture with high intrinsic
  robustness. We propose AdvRush, a novel adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture
  search algorithm, based upon a finding that independent of the training method,
  the intrinsic robustness of a neural network can be represented with the smoothness
  of its input loss landscape. Through a regularizer that favors a candidate architecture
  with a smoother input loss landscape, AdvRush successfully discovers an adversarially
  robust neural architecture. Along with a comprehensive theoretical motivation for
  AdvRush, we conduct an extensive amount of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy
  of AdvRush on various benchmark datasets. Notably, on CIFAR-10, AdvRush achieves
  55.91% robust accuracy under FGSM attack after standard training and 50.04% robust
  accuracy under AutoAttack after 7-step PGD adversarial training.

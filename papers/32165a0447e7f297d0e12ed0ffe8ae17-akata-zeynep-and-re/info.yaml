abstract: Image classification has advanced significantly in recent years with the
  availability of large-scale image sets. However, fine-grained classification remains
  a major challenge due to the annotation cost of large numbers of fine-grained categories.
  This project shows that compelling classification performance can be achieved on
  such categories even without labeled training data. Given image and class embeddings,
  we learn a compatibility function such that matching embeddings are assigned a higher
  score than mismatching ones; zero-shot classification of an image proceeds by finding
  the label yielding the highest joint compatibility score. We use state-of-the-art
  image features and focus on different supervised attributes and unsupervised output
  embeddings either derived from hierarchies or learned from unlabeled text corpora.
  We establish a substantially improved state-of-the-art on the Animals with Attributes
  and Caltech-UCSD Birds datasets. Most encouragingly, we demonstrate that purely
  unsupervised output embeddings (learned from Wikipedia and improved with fine-grained
  text) achieve compelling results, even outperforming the previous supervised state-of-the-art.
  By combining different output embeddings, we further improve results.
